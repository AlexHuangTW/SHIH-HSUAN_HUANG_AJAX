# SHIH-HSUAN_HUANG_AJAX

This project will be provided with links to an API which will output information about the earbuds as JSON. I will use the Fetch API to retrieve the data on page load and update the view as the user interacts with the hotspots and material list.

# Features

- Dynamic data retrieval using Fetch API.
- Interactive hotspots that display specific information about earbuds.
